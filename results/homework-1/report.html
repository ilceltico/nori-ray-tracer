Assignment was clear. Most of the time spent went into setting up GitHub, which is apparently a bit picky now in terms of authentication. SSH solved my issues.

Exercise writeup
================

GitHub setup
---------------------
Encountered problems due to authentication. Solved with SSH.

Spent around 1h on this.

---------------------
No problems encountered, spent around 30m.

Had fun comparing the performance on this task across different computers. For example an M1 Pro took around 0.75s, whereas an Intel-based MacBook from the same year took 2.8s. Impressive! When single-threaded, the M1 Pro was still 2-3x faster than the single-threaded Intel. A newer desktop i7-13700K took 0.5s, but consuming 5 times the power and using 16 cores.
