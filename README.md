A C++ implementation of a ray tracing rendering engine based on [Nori](https://wjakob.github.io/nori/), originally developed for the [Advanced Computer Graphics](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/advanced-computer-graphics-CS-440) course at EPFL and passed with 6/6.

Final scene showcasing most of the features, rendered with volume rendering. [Uncompressed version](./results/project/Final_image/base3_alternate_2048samples_Edited.png)

## Main features
- Volume rendering with multiple homogenous participating media
- Multiple importance sampling
- Texture and normal mapping
- Multiple materials, including rough and smooth dielectrics and conductors
- Point, area, directional and image-based lights
- Environment maps
- Depth of field
- Incremental rendering
